## Weather Data Classification

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data to classify whether the relative humidity at 9am would be high based on various meteorological features. By leveraging the power of machine learning, I built a model that predicts high humidity with impressive accuracy.

### Key Steps in the Project
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
2. *Feature Engineering*: Selected relevant features such as air pressure, air temperature, wind direction, and speed to use in the model.
3. *Model Training*: Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to classify the humidity levels.
4. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
5. *Visualization*: Created insightful visualizations to understand the model's predictions better.

### Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 92.05% on the test data.
- The model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing high humidity levels.

## Sales Performance Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze how advertising expenditures in TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels impact sales figures. By employing Linear Regression, I built a model that provides valuable insights into which advertising channels drive sales most effectively.

### Key Steps in the Project
1. *Data Exploration*: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between advertising spends and sales figures using pair plots and correlation matrices.
2. *Data Preparation*: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, ensuring it was ready for modeling by handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
3. *Model Building*: Trained a Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library, leveraging statsmodels for detailed statistical analysis.
4. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score to quantify predictive accuracy.
5. *Insights and Visualization*: Gained insights into the relative impact of TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising on sales. Visualized actual vs. predicted sales to understand model predictions better.

### Results
- Achieved a robust R-squared (R²) score of 92.25% on the test data, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
- Identified that TV advertising significantly influences sales, followed by Radio, while Newspaper ads showed comparatively lower impact.
